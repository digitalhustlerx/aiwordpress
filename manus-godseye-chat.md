Monday
I have analyzed your audio transcription and developed a comprehensive, actionable launch playbook for your "God's Eye" WordPress plugin.
This strategy is built around your 7-Day "Vibe Coding" Live Build Challenge and incorporates the "Grand Slam Offer" framework from Alex Hormozi and the "First Principles" approach from Elon Musk to maximize hype and conversion.
The attached document, "God's Eye" 7-Day Launch Playbook: Vibe Coding to Viral Hype, includes:
The Core Strategy: Positioning the live build as the primary marketing asset.
The Grand Slam Offer: A detailed structure for the Founder's Lifetime Deal to make the offer irresistible.
The 7-Day Narrative Arc: A day-by-day plan for your live stream content, from problem introduction to official launch.
Multi-Platform Content Plan: Specific content types and frequency for Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Substack, and Facebook to drive traffic and build credibility.
Landing Page and Sales Offer Design: Draft copy for your waitlist page and a tiered pricing structure using Paystack.
This playbook provides the structure you requested to "hold you by the balls directly" and execute a high-impact launch. Please review the document, and let me know if you would like to refine any part of the strategy.
"God's Eye" 7-Day Launch Playbook: Vibe Coding to Viral Hype
This playbook outlines the comprehensive promotion strategy for the "God's Eye" WordPress plugin, leveraging the "vibe coding" trend and incorporating the growth principles of Alex Hormozi and Elon Musk. The core of the strategy is the 7-Day Live Build Challenge, which serves as both product development and primary marketing.
I. The Core Strategy: First Principles Marketing
Following Elon Musk's First Principles Thinking, we break down the marketing problem to its core truth: the most compelling content for a software product is the process of its creation. Instead of spending time and money on traditional marketing, the product's development is the marketing.
The "vibe coding" live stream is the perfect vehicle for this, as it positions the founder as a cutting-edge builder using AI, which is highly shareable and engaging.
II. The Grand Slam Offer (Hormozi's Framework)
To ensure the offer is so good people feel "stupid saying no," we will structure a Grand Slam Offer around the launch.
