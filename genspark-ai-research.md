Or Twitter threads down to substack down to LinkedIn. Every hackable means, and ways for LinkedIn content. Be short, long, or whatever.  Are you there?  Then picture ideas, photo whatever and anything that could hack attention and purchasing power, from the size of chain, the behind the scenes Founders, you know, you know, maybe to hack founder sentiment or something.  Do you get all of that?  So, across all the channels across all of them.  And red team is ideas and maybe I'm not even seeing go the extra mile and find out.
